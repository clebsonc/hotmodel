# Problem description

Based on the provided dataset, identify which is the best variant of the experiment for all users.
In other words, if you had to choose only one version of the experiment, which one would it be?

In addition of that, create a model that will recommend a test variant for a user,
in order to maximize their monetization, but without losing engagement.

To answer that, all details are given in the [Home](https://hotmodel.streamlit.app/) app page.
